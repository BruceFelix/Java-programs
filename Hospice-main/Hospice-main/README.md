# Hospice
A simple sequence control structure
This is a control structure where instructiions are excuted one after the other in the order they were written for example in our Master Hospice Bill Program. The program first prompts for the patient Name, the days Admitted and then it computes Accommodation fee and total bill then finally it displays the information. This is in line with the way they were written one after the other.
